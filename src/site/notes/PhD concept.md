A [LaTeX document](tex/plan.pdf) that is about 2 pages long, and which shortly summarizes what I'd like to research.

The title could be something along these lines:
A set-based approach for evalating in-house material flow robustness


- Introduction: disturbances such as wood anc chip shortage, and stuff; more and more LEAN and on-demand stuff , Cyber-Physical systems

-SVRP-D, and DVRP-D

- self contained agents, such as in 

-Build material flow model

-To support business decison making

connect simulation with set based stuff -> decomposition -> robust, and exact
