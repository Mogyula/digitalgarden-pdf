Modeling logistics processes with differential equations.

[[A_Model_for_the_ Dynamics_of_large_Queuing_Networks.pdf]] states that following approaches exist:

- [[Discrete event simulations\|Discrete event simulations]] 
- [[Fluid models\|Fluid models]]
- [[Traffic flow models\|Traffic flow models]]

Just like with the power grids, the methods are either fast or precise --> [[Set-based approach\|Set-based approach]]. Might be relevant: [[A Robust Optimization Approach to Supply.pdf]], but this is also only conserned with [[Linear Programming Problem\|Linear Programming Problem]]s.

Decoupling would be important for us as well! 'd' might be internal, but also might be external.

Section 4.2 in [[A Theory of Supply Chains.pdf]] has something similar to viability theory?

Good search terms:
- Supply chain dynamics
- Inventory

---

We are not interested in [[Dynamical programming\|Dynamical programming]] that much, more like critical inventory.

## Optimization with unknown/uncertain parameters:
[[Reducing_Conservatism_in_Robust_Optimization.pdf]]
- Stochasctic [[Lectures_on_stochastic_programming_Modeling_and_th.pdf]]
	- Have to know historical data or something
- Robust
	- These are more like set-based. 

### Set-based uncertainty

Admissible inventory --> We can manufacture a given stuff, but then other orders cannot be fulfilled?

Existing methods for Robust inventory: 3.1 in [[The_Impact of Modeling on Robust Inventory Management Under Demand Uncertainty.pdf]]:

- Pure Robust
- Budget of Uncertainty Robust
- Affinely Adjustable Robust
- Approximate Objective Function (See and Sim)
- Nonlinear Robust
- Scenario based

[[Robust inventory control under demand and lead time uncertainty.pdf]] also gives a good overview

THIS ONE! [[Recent_advances_in_robust_optimization_An_overview.pdf]]

Robust counterparts and ellipsoid metods 
[[Robust_optimization_model_for_closed_loop_supply_chain.pdf]]
[[Robust_solutions_of_uncertain_linear_programs.pdf]]

These are still probabilistic though, also: Conservativism
[[Reducing_Conservatism_in_Robust_Optimization 1.pdf]]

Bartismas2004 solved the Conservativism?, but still, approximate?

"Light Robustness" in [[robust-and-online-largescale-optimization-2009.pdf]] which combines robustnes with a stochstic approach

We do not care about money stuff.
We also do not care about vehicle routing.

---

We bascically have to put everything here into the [[PhD concept\|PhD concept]]

---

Maybe find a hot topic and use that as a vehicle (like pharmaceutical logistics /think of vaccines/ or aid distribution or emergency services etc.) for funding and presentability.
